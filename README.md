## 🌐 About the Project

**Fakebook** is a realistic-looking login interface designed to raise awareness about phishing attacks and how easily people can be tricked into entering sensitive information into fake websites.

Once users "log in," they're presented with a fictional account (e.g., *Chintu Hacker*) that educates them about phishing, social engineering, and digital hygiene.
